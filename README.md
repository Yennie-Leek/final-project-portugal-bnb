# Final Project: Portugal B&B

This site is a fullstack application that was made as the final project of Technigo Boot Camp of spring 2021, developed and pair-programmed by <a href="https://github.com/Yennie-Leek">Yennie Leek</a> and <a href="https://github.com/idasylven">Ida Sylvén.</a>

The idea for our project came from having a dream of opening a hostel/bnb in Portugal in the future, so we thought that it could be cool to do a “mock-up” page for it! The main purpose is to help the customers to book rooms and for the owner to market the business. The atmosphere of the B&B will be personal, friendly and a bit adventurous!

When it comes to frontend development we find content and styling very inspiring and fun, so working on that was a big part of the project. Over all we have set up a base structure to continue to build on.

# Technologies & Tools

- React
- Redux
- CSS
- RESTful API, Mongoose schema and POST request endpoint
- Mongo DB to store the guest information in our database
- Express
- Node.js
- React Datepicker calendar to create a reservation
- Google Maps API with the key restricted in Google Cloud Platform to the unique page URL
- React Icons for social media & hamburger menu icons
- SVG Icons for custom pin indicators on Google Map
- Snazzy Maps for custom styling of the Google Map
- Flexbox for layout
- Media Queries for responsiveness in mobile, tablet and desktop view
- Browser Testing in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge
- DaFont custom font import for company graphics and logotype font
- Favicon
- Miro for concept development: mood board, color schemes, images, copywriting and the initial sketches for the various devices

# Planning

We started out by creating a clear concept of our project - we did a lot of research for our mood board and for the initial sketches of the different layouts. After setting up all front- and backend files we started out by doing the main functionalities of our site. As we both find this aspect quite challengeing, we worked together on this particular part of the project. For styling and content we divided the tasks and worked separately, merging all the final details together in the end. We are very happy with our team work and communication during this project!

# Problems

We ran into a lot of problems along the way, they were all very frustrating at the time - but we've also learned a lot and got a deeper understanding for several errors and issues by solving them. One realisation is that the planning and trouble shooting parts of the project take way longer than doing the actual syntax.
As the project expands it becomes clear that it takes experience in understanding how to plan and structure bigger projects. We find that it easily tends to get scattered and a bit inconsistent when it comes to naming, nesting and creating components. The bigger the project gets, the harder it becomes to keep it clean and simple.

# For the future

We have plenty of additional ideas for this project - both in terms of further functionalities and content as well as improvements of current features. Our main goals are to:

- Syncronise with AirBnb Calendar
- Display input error messages in the frontend
- Make labels for our map icons (location of house and activities)
- To have valid links (social media and activities)
- Fix our bug (text-aligning) with the button when using mobile
- Defactor and re-position the social media icons + fix Instagram icon composition bug in Safari
- Expand with further information and links about the separate rooms
- Tweak of styling, and with a focus on forms and confirmation
- Send confirmation via email after the reservation is complete
